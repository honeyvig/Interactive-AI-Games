# Interactive-AI-Games
We are seeking a skilled Mobile App Developer to build the core features of our app, Seekify, which includes two AI-powered interactive games. The focus of this project is on implementing a simple, fun, and engaging app experience with a robust reward system. You will work with our team to bring this vision to life by integrating AI technologies, user profiles, and a rewards system that includes points and coins.
This project is part of a phased development approach. Phase 1 focuses on building core features and interactive games, while future phases will introduce more advanced functionality, including location-based activity suggestions, multiplayer capabilities, and social media integration.
Responsibilities (Phase 1):
• Sign Up and Login: Implement a basic authentication system for user accounts (email/password).
• Profile and Preferences: Allow users to set up profiles with activity preferences (e.g., favorite activities, interests, and locations).
• Interactive Games with AI: Develop 2-4 games, such as the Explore Challenge and Global Word Hunt, using AI/image recognition to compare results:
o Explore Challenge: Players find and photograph items based on specific criteria (color, shape, texture, etc.).
o Word Hunt: Players search for items based on a random letter, submitting photos for AI analysis.
o Game definitions and additional details are available in the attached document.
• Points-to-Rewards System: Develop a point system where players earn rewards based on difficulty levels:
o Easy: 10 points per item.
o Medium: 20 points per item.
o Hard: 30 points per item.
o Rewards include in-game power-ups, cosmetic upgrades, special challenges, and leaderboard badges.
• Coins System: Implement a coin-based currency that players can purchase or earn through gameplay:
o Coins can be used for power-ups, unlocking challenges, and purchasing cosmetic items.
o Players can exchange points for coins or use coins to boost scores.
• Combining Points and Coins: Create a complementary system where rewards are based on both points and coins.
• (Optional) Instagram Integration: Enable users to share their game results (e.g., photos, scavenger hunt results) directly to Instagram for app promotion.
Skills Required:
• Strong proficiency in mobile app development for iOS and Android platforms (React Native or Flutter preferred).
• Experience with AI and image recognition technologies (e.g., TensorFlow, Core ML).
• Knowledge of in-app purchases and creating coin-based or points-based systems.

====================
For building the core features of the Seekify mobile app, which includes AI-powered interactive games, user profiles, a reward system, and social media integration, the following Python code snippets are provided. The code focuses on implementing a React Native app (you can adapt it for Flutter if preferred), user authentication, game mechanics, points and coins system, and the basic integration of AI for interactive games. The AI integration can be further enhanced using TensorFlow or Core ML for image recognition.
Step 1: Set up the Basic Project with React Native

npx react-native init SeekifyApp
cd SeekifyApp
npx react-native run-android  # For Android
npx react-native run-ios      # For iOS

Step 2: Implement User Authentication (Email/Password)

You can use Firebase Authentication for handling user sign-ups and logins.

Install Firebase SDK:

npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth

Authentication Code (Sign Up & Log In)

import auth from '@react-native-firebase/auth';

const signUp = async (email, password) => {
  try {
    await auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
    console.log('User account created & signed in!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
};

const signIn = async (email, password) => {
  try {
    await auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
    console.log('User signed in!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
};

Step 3: Set Up User Profile and Preferences

Store user preferences in Firestore, where users can define their favorite activities, interests, and locations.

Install Firebase Firestore SDK:

npm install @react-native-firebase/firestore

User Profile Setup

import firestore from '@react-native-firebase/firestore';

const createUserProfile = async (userId, preferences) => {
  try {
    await firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).set({
      preferences: preferences,
    });
    console.log('User profile created!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
};

Step 4: Create AI-Powered Interactive Games

The games involve object recognition and image comparison. You can integrate TensorFlow Lite or Core ML for image recognition.

    Explore Challenge Game: Players find items based on criteria (color, shape, etc.), take a picture, and use AI to compare the result.

Install TensorFlow Lite (React Native)

npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native

Image Recognition Function (For Explore Challenge)

import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
import '@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const loadModel = async () => {
  await tf.ready();
  const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path_to_model/model.json');
  return model;
};

const recognizeImage = async (imageData) => {
  const model = await loadModel();
  const tensor = tf.browser.fromPixels(imageData);
  const prediction = model.predict(tensor.expandDims(0));
  return prediction;
};

    Word Hunt Game: Players search for items based on a random letter and submit photos for AI analysis.

AI-based Word Hunt Recognition

// Similar AI logic can be used for Word Hunt to compare photos against the letter generated.

Step 5: Implement Points and Rewards System

Players earn points based on difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).

Points System Logic

const calculatePoints = (difficulty) => {
  switch (difficulty) {
    case 'easy':
      return 10;
    case 'medium':
      return 20;
    case 'hard':
      return 30;
    default:
      return 0;
  }
};

const updateUserPoints = async (userId, difficulty) => {
  const points = calculatePoints(difficulty);
  try {
    await firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).update({
      points: firestore.FieldValue.increment(points),
    });
    console.log(`User earned ${points} points!`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
};

Step 6: Implement Coins System

Players earn coins that can be used for power-ups, challenges, and cosmetic upgrades.

Coins System

const earnCoins = async (userId, amount) => {
  try {
    await firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).update({
      coins: firestore.FieldValue.increment(amount),
    });
    console.log(`${amount} coins added!`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
};

const useCoinsForPowerUp = async (userId, cost) => {
  try {
    const userDoc = await firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).get();
    const coins = userDoc.data().coins;
    if (coins >= cost) {
      await firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).update({
        coins: firestore.FieldValue.increment(-cost),
      });
      console.log(`Power-up activated!`);
    } else {
      console.log('Not enough coins!');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
};

Step 7: Optional Instagram Integration

To allow users to share their game results on Instagram, you can use the react-native-share library.

Install react-native-share:

npm install react-native-share

Sharing to Instagram

import Share from 'react-native-share';

const shareToInstagram = async (imageUri) => {
  try {
    const shareOptions = {
      title: 'Seekify Game Results',
      url: imageUri,  // Path to the image you want to share
      social: Share.Social.INSTAGRAM,
    };
    await Share.shareSingle(shareOptions);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sharing to Instagram:', error);
  }
};

Step 8: Build and Test the App

    Test your interactive games to ensure they run smoothly.
    Test the point and coin system with a sample user.
    Test user profile creation and ensure the authentication system works correctly.
    Integrate AI models for image recognition and ensure accurate game results.

Future Phases

For Phase 2 and Phase 3, you can follow these strategies:

    Location-Based Activity Finder: Integrate a map service like Google Maps API to fetch user location and suggest activities nearby.
    Multiplayer Mode: Use Firebase Realtime Database or Socket.IO for real-time multiplayer game functionalities.
    Social Features: Continue integrating social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, for seamless sharing.

By following these steps, you can build the core features of the Seekify app in Phase 1 and set the foundation for the more advanced features in future phases.
